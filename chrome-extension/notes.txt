Greasemonkey vs Extensions vs Plugins

Greasemonkey:
    Super easy. Write once, work everywhere.
    Have to do a hack if you want arbitrary websites to take advantage of the script
        (make a div with an id in the html, then check for the id's existence and only load the python interpreter when that happens)
    Annoying to deal with quoting strings of Python code

Extension:
    Different API for each browser
    Chrome:
        var myPort=chrome.extension.connect('yourextensionid_qwerqweroijwefoijwef', some_object_to_send_on_connect);
        (less hacky, since extension will only run when you want it to)
        (untested -- guy on stack overflow hasn't tried it)
    Firefox:
        Same as greasemonkey
        Firefox hates the XPI package from the greasmonkey
< img src=”chrome://youraddonname/content/skin/images/anyimagefilename” width=”0″ height=”0″ onload=”javascript: checkAddon()” style=”visibility:hidden” > (conditional to check if installed)

Plugin:
    Compile with FireBreath
